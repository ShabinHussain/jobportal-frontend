              </ul>
              <h5>CV checklist</h5>
              <p>The CV should:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Have a clear layout</li>
                <li>Be 1 to 2 A4 pages in length only</li>
                <li>Contain no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors</li>
                <li>Use bold print to highlight headings, qualifications, names of employers, and positions held</li>
                <li>Use the same font and size throughout. For example, this page uses the Arial font with the main text in 12 point size and the headings in 14 point.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Why should I include a personal profile?</h5>
              <p>It tells the interviewer at a glance what you have to offer and what type of position you are interested in. A personal profile is a short paragraph that goes near the top of your CV. If you are applying for different jobs, you should adapt your personal profile and CV to suit each job.</p>
              <h5>What if there are gaps in my employment history?</h5>
              <p>If there are gaps in your employment history, try to give positive details about how you used your time during the gaps. For example, you may have taken a year out to travel, worked as a volunteer on a particular project, returned to college to study, and so on. It's best if you can give good reasons for the gaps rather than leave questions for the reader.</p>
              <h5>Tips on writing a covering letter</h5>
              <p>When you send a CV to apply for an advertised position, you should always send a cover letter with it.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Address the cover letter to a named person in the company.</li>
                <li>Name the position you are applying for and say that you have enclosed your CV.</li>
                <li>Use a font such as Arial that is easy to read.</li>
                <li>Keep the cover letter to one page if possible but definitely no longer than two pages.</li>
                <li>Sign the letter if you are posting it or include a digital signature if you are sending it by email.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When sending your CV to a company 'on spec' (that is, when there is no job advertised):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Address the letter to the relevant department or section in the company.</li>
                <li>Name the position you are interested in.</li>
                <li>Focus the letter on the potential employer's needs.</li>
                <li>Say when you are available for an interview.</li>
                <li>Use a font such as Arial which is easy to read.</li>
                <li>Make sure there are no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors in the letter.</li>
                <li>Sign the letter if you are posting it or include a digital signature if you are sending it by email.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Tips on how to prepare for a job interview</h5>
              <p>Before the interview</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Be clear about why you want the job. Make sure you understand what the job involves and what the company does.</li>
                <li>Know your CV inside out. It creates a bad impression if you're not able to talk about your qualifications, interests, and experience.</li>
                <li>Have a list of answers to possible questions ready. Try to anticipate what you will be asked and practice answering questions out loud.</li>
                <li>Some interviews are based on the competencies (skills) needed to do the job. These are usually outlined in the job description. When preparing for competency-based interviews, base examples of your skills on the indicators outlined under each competency.</li>
                <li>Presentation is very important. You should dress suitably for the interview.</li>
                <li>Arrive at least 15 minutes early.</li>
                <li>Take all interviews seriously no matter how informal they may seem.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>At the interview</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Make eye contact with the interviewer and greet them politely.</li>
                <li>Be honest about why you want the job or have left a previous job. If you are leaving an old job, be positive about the reasons for your decision.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge your weaknesses but present them as strengths or opportunities to develop.</li>
                <li>Expect the unexpected such as awkward questions or a sudden request to demonstrate a skill.</li>
                <li>Be positive, be confident, and smile.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>How to complete an application form</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Read through the whole form and the instructions before filling in any sections.</li>
                <li>Photocopy or write the questions on rough paper and answer them before you fill in the form.</li>
                <li>Follow any instructions as to how the form should be completed. For example, some forms ask you to use black ink or block capitals only.</li>
                <li>Answer all parts of every question. If the question does not apply to you then mark it 'not applicable' or 'N/A'.</li>
                <li>Keep a copy of the completed application form to read over before your interview.</li>
                <li>Make sure you use the correct address, or email address, to send the application form to.</li>
                <li>Check spelling, punctuation, and grammar.</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Questions you might be asked at interview</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Can you talk us through your CV?</li>
                <li>Why did you leave your last job?</li>
                <li>Why do you wish to leave your current position?</li>
